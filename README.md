# qt_modelViewBooks

Instead of using Qt’s model-view approach, it is possible to use its item view convenience classes. Using a QListWidget, write an application to manage a list of book titles. The application should support the following.
• The user should be able to add a book title via a text entry field and button. The book should only be added to the list if it is not already in the list. Warn the user if data is not inserted into the model.
• The user should be able to delete a book that is selected in the view (ensuring that the user does want to delete the title). Add a button to the GUI to achieve this.
• The list of book titles is maintained in alphabetical order. This should be true when data is edited in the view as well.
